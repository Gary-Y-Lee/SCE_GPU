# SCE_GPU

## Installation
The installation of the GPU cluster utilizes the OCI stack from the provided link: [oracle-quickstart/oci-hpc](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-hpc)

When configuring HPC + GPU clustering in OCI, the official recommendation is to use OCI-validated images. OCI performs testing and validation across OS type, compute shape, OFED, and CUDA versions, and publishes the validated images on the Confluence page as shown below. These images are updated twice a year.
